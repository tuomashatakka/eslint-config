# Rules for my linter

Heavily opionated yet heavily clean and effective linter configuration for ESLint.

For Next, React and TS


### Todo

- Style imports aren't yet enforced to have an empty line between them and other imports.
- I really love Python's enforced linting style for having two rows between major blocks
  and 1 row between minor. I should finish my block padding plugin some day for the ESLinter.
  My linting rules would really appreciate that.
